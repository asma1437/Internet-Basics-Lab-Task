A sorting algorithm organizes an array or list of elements based on a comparison operator, which determines their order in the data structure. There are five fundamental sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. These serve as the foundation for developing other algorithms. Each algorithm has its advantages and disadvantages, making them suitable for different data sizes and use cases.
